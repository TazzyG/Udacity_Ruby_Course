I started out with Python but got lost in Pygames. I was using a book and didn't know about the importance of Versions and how APIs can be out of date.
Also, learned Node.js but as I was a rookie, it was hard to keep up. When I learned one thing, I would have more questions. 
Since Ruby documentation was so good, and friends recommended it, I decided to learn Ruby on Rails. I have been through many online sources and books but tended to find I didn't know how to apply something after the lesson.

Today, I have an app started and am applying as I learn. I am concerned about asking for help without putting in the effort to solve things myself. 

Ruby Dev - I would like to be able to feel comfortable with creating an app, using gems appropriately, design patterns, testing with RSpec and using Postgres with Ruby on Rails.
